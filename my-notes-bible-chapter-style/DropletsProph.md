# üìñ DropletsProph ‚Äî My Personal Book of Warnings, Stories, and Trust in God

> This document is NOT the Bible. This is me, Droplet, writing my own symbolic chapters of life, faith, fear, weird moments, spooky lore, and calling out stuff that goes against God's word.  
> These are NOT to be taken as sacred scripture, but as personal reflection using chapter-style formats that mirror the Bible.

## Chapter 0 ‚Äî The Preface of Droplet

0:1 These words are not canon, not sacred law, nor hidden scroll from ancient temples. They are the scribbles of a soul seeking God, written with humor, fear, and faith.

0:2 Let it be known to all future eyes: this is not scripture, but a reflection. Not divine law, but divine-inspired thought from a child of the internet.

0:3 May no one worship these words, but let them spark worship of the One who deserves it. The Lord, not the Droplet.

## Chapter 1 ‚Äî Of Creation and Corruption

1:1 In the beginning, the Lord made crystals, and He saw that they were shiny. And He said, ‚ÄúYe may admire them, but do not try to talk to spirits through them, blud.‚Äù

1:2 He formed wood for fire, shelter, and furniture‚Äînot to carve into cursed figurines nor to burn incense to the vibes of the void.

1:3 He shaped mankind from dust and breathed life into them‚Äînot so they would summon, manifest, enchant, or download horoscope apps.

1:4 Knowledge was given to build, to heal, to pray, to farm, to vibe‚Äînot to open gates to forbidden realms through rituals, truth-telling spirits, or ‚Äúzodiac compatibility tests.‚Äù

1:5 He said, ‚ÄúWorship Me, not Mercury retrograde.‚Äù And the wise did nod, but the fools checked their daily forecast.

1:6 And so it was that the Lord made good things, but man kept tryna remix them into spiritual DLCs He never approved.

1:7 Let it be known: creation is sacred.

1:8 And the Lord said, ‚ÄúDo not be like Simon, who tried to buy My Spirit like it was for sale. My power is not coin-fed, nor merchandised.‚Äù

1:9 Please do not be a fool seekin‚Äô to use astrology apps on thy Android from 2018 for unholy, unreal purposes. Trust in the Word, not the widget.

## Chapter 2 ‚Äî Disclaimers and Scribbled Psalms

2:1 If ever thou feel judged, threatened, or shamed by one who wears a cross but acts without grace, do not run from the Lord because of them.

2:2 For His love is not the love of the rigid, the prideful, or the self-righteous. He is not as they are.

2:3 Stay with God, even if church folk forget what love is. Stay with the Shepherd, not the sheep that bite.

2:4 And if ever they press you to fear without reason, know this: your Father is not like man. His correction is never cruel.

2:5 I once struggled within, not with man, but with shadows. My soul trembled when the lights turned off, and my heart knew not peace.

2:6 I saw things move that had no form. I feared what had no name. My hand scribbled what my voice could not say.

2:7 Upon my wall I carved the cross‚Äînot for art, but for safety. Beneath it, I wrote a psalm, though I barely remembered the words.

2:8 And then the weight lifted. The air shifted. A strange calm fell upon me, not from inside, but from above.

2:9 I knew then: His Word is armor. The cross is not decoration, but declaration.

2:10 Let it be known‚Äîwhen fear finds you in the dark, draw His name upon the walls of your heart.

## Chapter 3 ‚Äî The Pale One Beneath

3:1 And there was a tale passed down from my grandmother, who lived before me in a house surrounded by many, yet haunted by one.

3:2 Her sister, or perhaps an aunt, was tormented in the night. Something came‚Äîa tall, pale figure, like a man from the old world, but with no head.

3:3 It would carry her from her bed into the yard, silent and cold. She did not walk. She was taken.

3:4 The family grew afraid. The father, strong in faith, stayed behind to see for himself.

3:5 He slept in the girl‚Äôs place. And when the shadow came, reaching with hands unseen, he rose and shouted, ‚ÄúIn the name of GOD, YOU LEAVE.‚Äù

3:6 And it left. The air broke. The father fell.

3:7 In the days that followed, they dug. Hours became days. Shovels and prayer struck the ground.

3:8 Until they found it‚Äîbeneath the dirt, a sarcophagus. Inside, the bones of an indigenous man, long buried and unrested.

3:9 When it was removed, the house found peace. No more footsteps. No more whispers. No more fear.

3:10 Let it be remembered: the darkness flees from the name of the Lord. Even the oldest unrest bows to the Almighty.

3:11 When fear wakes you, and horror finds your home, speak His name‚Äînot as a whisper, but as a sword.

## Chapter 4 ‚Äî On Bones and Blessings

4:1 The land we walk may seem ordinary, but not all peace is born in silence. Some peace is won in battle.

4:2 I now know this: beneath my uncle‚Äôs steps lie the memory of a shout. A father‚Äôs shout. A divine command that shook the unseen.

4:3 The place that once held fear now holds laughter, cooking, voices. And they do not know that ghosts once tried to live there.

4:4 But I remember. And I am grateful. For the Lord does not forget where He has cast out darkness.

4:5 Let no one think that what is hidden is harmless. What is buried may still breathe unrest‚Äîuntil God says, ‚ÄúPeace.‚Äù

4:6 The lesson remains: Trust in the Lord, even when the thing that grabs you has no face. Even when it hides below, even when others don't believe.

4:7 Because fear can last nights, but His Word lasts forever.

## Chapter 5 ‚Äî On Truth Tellers and Staying True

5:1 Before I was born, my mother walked through a place not holy, but curious. And for fun, she heard the voice of a truth teller.

5:2 The words said, ‚ÄúYou will have a child.‚Äù And it came to pass. But the Lord did not need a fortune to make me real‚ÄîHe already knew my name.

5:3 Even when the prediction was true, I was not born from magic nor signs‚ÄîI was born from breath and purpose.

5:4 Do not follow the ones who speak what happens. Follow the One who makes things happen.

5:5 If a truth teller says something real, let not your heart chase their voice. Let it cling to God's Word, for His truth needs no tarot.

## Chapter 6 ‚Äî Of Dreams and Departures

6:1 There was a man, uncle to me, once strong, once walking in the mornings with a heartbeat of thunder. But time came knocking.

6:2 His body grew tired. His heart whispered warnings. And he spoke no pride, only this: ‚ÄúPlease pray for me.‚Äù

6:3 And the Lord heard, though the man himself stayed silent in prayer. Still, the Lord watches even those who don't know how to speak.

6:4 He began to dream. The faces of the departed visited him, and he felt himself standing among them. The message was clear: You may be next.

6:5 Fear did not scream, but it settled. A soft heaviness, like dust on old furniture. Not horror, but holy pause.

6:6 A transplant could be his lifeline, yet no matter the result, he said no bitterness. He asked not for guarantees, but for peace.

6:7 Let this be written: if death must come, let it not find you angry. Let it find you prayed for.

6:8 Let your final breath not be spent fighting the air, but whispering ‚ÄúI am ready.‚Äù

6:9 And may the deadbed not be filled with sorrow, but with soft songs, hands held, prayers lifted like fog.

6:10 If this speaks to you, then pray for them. And if you are them, pray for yourself. That your soul may ascend clean and light, unafraid.

6:11 For the Lord is not only for the living, but also for the dying. He is Shepherd to both roads.

## Chapter 7 ‚Äî The Idol in the Mirror

7:1 There once rose a man who demanded worship, but gave no grace. He took the throne not of holiness, but of hunger and hatred.

7:2 He said, ‚ÄúBow to me,‚Äù and those who stood were broken. Whole families disappeared into the shadows of his prisons.

7:3 He silenced the name of God. He burned Bibles and choked churches. And in the void, he placed his own name.

7:4 He feasted while his people starved. He built weapons while children built bones from famine.

7:5 He called the south ‚Äúpuppet,‚Äù though they were freer than his skies. His phones rewrote truth. His words turned maps into lies.

7:6 They worshiped a corpse with statues and songs. They were told, ‚ÄúNo god exists but the one who walks in flesh.‚Äù But the flesh they praised led only to graves.

7:7 And still, they followed. For fear ruled louder than truth. And he, drunk with devotion, mistook fear for faith.

7:8 Let it be known: any man who demands worship is no god. He is clay, pretending to be the potter.

7:9 And the Lord does not sleep. Every labor camp, every tear, every public scream‚ÄîHe has seen.

7:10 A kingdom built on fear is already crumbling. A name raised above God's will not be remembered in Heaven.

7:11 Let all rulers hear this: your gold will not save you. Your missiles will not lift you. Your titles will not protect you when the throne above roars.

7:12 The mirror may show power. But it hides blood. And the blood cries out.
